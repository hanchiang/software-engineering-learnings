# Introduction

I first started learning Go in mid-2018 during my internship when I got to work a little on backend development.

I liked the clean and concise syntax and the powerful standard library, but was put off by certain design choices:

- Mandatory storage of Go projects in `$GOPATH`
- Capitalisation of variable for determining visibility outside of package
- Oversimplified way of handling errors

## Javascript beginnings

Since I started working full time in 2019, I was happily full stack applications in javascript with great velocity.

Typescript is useful and saved me precious time in debugging incorrect function arguments and parameters type when I changed a part of the code but not the other corresponding parts.

The npm ecosystem contains tons of packages, and it is possible to find almost anything that you need.

However, as much as javascript is easy to use and fun to code in, its ecosystem is fragmented and it is common for a small hobby project to contain dozens of trivial dependencies.

## Good to go

In 2020, I decided to give Go another chance and expose myself to the issues and solutions surrounding concurrency, and pleasantly surprised by how effective of goroutines and channels are in managing shared variables.

The standard library is powerful, built-in testing tool is simple and efficient.

Also, go module is one of the greatest pull factor towards Go as it frees me from the constraint of having projects in `$GOPATH`.
