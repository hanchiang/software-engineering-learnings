# Introduction

I picked up this course earlier in 2020 to learn the basics of setting up a AWS infrastructure

Although this course is geared towards the AWS solutions architect certification, the materials discussed are useful to understand the core services such as VPC, IAM, EC2, ELB, ASG, Route 53, S3, RDS, etc.
