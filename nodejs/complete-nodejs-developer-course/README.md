# Introduction

The complete nodejs developer course is the first course I took.

The instructor Andrew Mead is knowledgeable, speaks clearly, provides a comprehensive learning from setting up development envrionment, debugging, API security, testing and finally deployment.

One of the most useful parts of a course is the projects that you get to do yourself, and Andrew offers realistic real world projects built with **React** and **Node.js** that take into account the best development practices.
